    <h1>Git is awesome.</h1>
    <p>
    Git is a free and open source distributed 
    version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects 
    with speed and efficiency. 

Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. 
It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.
